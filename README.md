BATS is proud to be San Francisco’s premier home for improvised theatre.
We've been innovating improv for over 30 years! We have shows every Friday and
Saturday at 8pm at our theatre in Fort Mason Center (right across from The
Interval's delicious craft cocktails, coffee & tea). Come on a Friday for one
of our fast-paced, variety-packed shortform shows. Or come on a Saturday for
one of our world-famous genre longform shows. Either way, you’re sure to
experience the unique blend of theatre and comedy that is BATS Improv. We also
offer classes at all levels for individuals, and customized corporate training
and experiences through our Improv @ Work program.
